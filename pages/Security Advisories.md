- ### [[Cross Site Scripting (XSS)]]
  https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/
	- _**Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** attacks are a type of injection, in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted websites._ **XSS** attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side script, to a different end user. _Flaws that allow these attacks to succeed are quite widespread and occur anywhere a web application uses input from a user within the output it generates without validating or encoding it._
		- 94% of the applications were tested for some form of injection with a max incidence rate of 19%, an average incidence rate of 3%, and 274k occurrences.
		- _Notable Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs) included are **CWE-79: Cross-site Scripting**, **CWE-89: SQL Injection**, and **CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path**._
